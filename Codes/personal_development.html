        <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
        <p>
            After reading Chapters 4–7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em>, several principles stood out to me that I can apply to my own personal and professional growth as an aspiring programmer. One of the major takeaways is the importance of setting clear goals. In the book, Jim Rohn emphasizes that without setting clear, actionable goals, we drift without direction. This resonates deeply with me, as I have clear aspirations to become one of the best programmers and contribute meaningfully to the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another concept that struck me was the idea of discipline and creating positive habits. Rohn stresses the idea that successful people develop routines that reinforce their vision, and it’s the consistency of these habits that builds long-term success. As a student of computer science, I’ve come to realize that mastering programming languages like Python and Java requires exactly this kind of discipline. By dedicating daily time to learning and coding, I’m gradually getting closer to achieving my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the concept of personal development and continual learning from the book aligns with my own values. As Rohn and Widener discuss, improving one’s skills and knowledge is essential for success. In the fast-paced world of technology, the need to adapt and grow is crucial, and I believe this mindset will help me navigate future challenges. Whether it's learning new programming languages or working on cutting-edge projects, I plan to continuously invest in my growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, the lessons from <em>Twelve Pillars</em> have reinforced the idea that success doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of setting goals, building habits, and dedicating yourself to personal development—all of which I intend to apply as I continue my journey as a programmer.

        <h2>My Academic Journey and Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This program has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and analytical thinking. Two key skills that I have developed so far are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proficiency in Programming Languages:</strong> I’ve gained expertise in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS, which I’ve applied in building projects like my personal portfolio website.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Through building this portfolio website and other projects, I’ve developed skills in designing and creating user-friendly web interfaces using pure HTML and CSS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As I continue my degree, I look forward to expanding these skills and diving deeper into areas like software development, full-stack development, and artificial intelligence.
